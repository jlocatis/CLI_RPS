BEST OF FIVE ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
This is a program that plays the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is written in Ruby. It will be a best of five series of games between two players. It tracks individual scores between both players as well as any ties that occur.

SETUP
You can run the game from the main.rb file, but it will require the functions.rb file in the same directory in order to run. Simply head to your command line terminal and type in "main ruby.rb".

HOW TO USE
The game will prompt for each player one at a time. Unfortunately as written Player 2 will always see what Player 1 enters. After both players have entered their selections the game will determine the winner of the round and display the current score for the game. Once a player reaches three wins the program will declare a winner and the game is over!

The program's functions may also be tested by running test.rb.
